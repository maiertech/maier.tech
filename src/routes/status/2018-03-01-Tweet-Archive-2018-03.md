> Just a reminder how ridiculous the @MTA @NYCTBus stroller policy is, which forces parents to take infants out of stroller and folding stroller while on the bus. Just watched a mum struggling to keep balance holding baby while folding stroller. You can still sign the petition ðŸ‘‡ https://twitter.com/mdotasia/status/945409035267850240

> Stroller Q: @NYCTBus folded stroller policy makes it impossible to take infant on bus (try it out). Stroller on @NYCTSubway is hard due to lack/state of elevators &amp; overcrowded. R U willing to challenge @MTA board on bus policy and we-do-not-need-more-elevators attitude? #AskNYCT

> CBTC is announced by @NYCTSubway as solution for signal problems. Yet CBTC on 7 train is still not complete. On E train scheduled for 2021 (or was it 2031?), no other lines in the pipeline. Other cities roll it out in a few months. This is absolutely ridiculous. #AskNYCT

> My daily commute can be as short as 44mins door to door. However my median commute is 59mins because of signal problems, overcrowding and you name it (stats done with @Citymapper). I'm losing at least 100 hours per year thanks to @NYCTBus and @NYCTSubway. Any thoughts? #AskNYCT
