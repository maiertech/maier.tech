> Second credit card breach this year and no big reset moment this time thanks to @PrivacyHQ. Bank issued credit cards have lately turned into junk cards due to massive online and offline fraud. Banks need to step up their anti-credit-card-fraud game.

> The robo call lobby is on track to train everyone to not answer the phone any more. My robo calls to legitimate calls ratio feels like 50:1. There is absolutely no point picking up any phone calls any more.

> Often customer service should be renamed to customer insult. Services I’m perfectly happy with make me wanna cancel because their first line of support treats customers like idiots. Canned responses and script abiding reps that do not listen are toxic @Target @amazon @juno @uber

> @wesbos You keep saying on @syntaxfm that devs have a high BS tolerance. You probably meant to say low BS tolerance. An ounce of BS is probably enough to trigger their BS sensor. A ton of BS will probably drive them up the wall big time.

> I think this is a great start but some commitments are really vague. I would rather see fewer commitments but formulated SMART. Would make it easier to monitor progress. E.g. repairing switch has no inherent value for riders. Improving average on time performance has great value.

> All @GetSpectrum did since the merger is bump up the price for plain residential internet from 34.99$ to 39.99$ to 44.99$. They promise 200Mbps when often I get as low as 5Mbps testing against their own servers. The only thing that flies is their profits. @Ask_Spectrum https://twitter.com/maiertech/status/1023058676305862656
