> You lament about a problem that most other big cities have fixed with platform screen doors and modern articulated trains. Most of your most pressing problems are the direct result of how @MTA @NYCTSubway runs and manages public transit.

> Monday morning commute: overcrowded Q37 with empty bus 019 passing full bus 703 without stopping. Now in someone’s living room on E train car 9130 and it smells like a zoo. Were we not to see improvements by end of year, @NYCTSubway @NYCTBus?

> It's a mystery how @BestBuy makes any money when they cancel every single order we place because "we experienced a problem verifying some of your information". But we won't tell you what we could not verify. I won't shed a tear when you go out of business, @BestBuySupport.

> How to exchange your expiring #metrocard: 1 insert card with expiration date 01/31/2019 into machine. 2 choose to swap it for new one. 3 Receive new card with expiration 01/31/2019. 4 Repeat as long as you please. 5 when fed up go to booth and get barked at. @MTA @NYCTSubway.
