> For low usage on the previously free and unlimited (pay as you go) plans the new pricing and limits really hurt. Drastically increased rather than drastically simplified. Yes, unlimited users are grandfathered in, but for new side projects on new org 20$ per month is steep.

> @chrisbiscardi in your yarn workspaces post's Fin para (https://www.christopherbiscardi.com/post/multi-package-repos-with-yarn/#fin) you mention build steps for individual packages. When package has build step and is used in another package, do I need to run build step manually every time I make changes or can I automate this?
